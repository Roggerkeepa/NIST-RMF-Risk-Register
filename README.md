# NIST RMF Risk Register – Sofunny101Cloud SaaS Startup

## Overview
This project demonstrates a NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)–aligned risk assessment for a 10-employee cloud-based SaaS startup operating on AWS. The objective is to identify, assess, prioritize, and respond to cybersecurity risks using industry-standard methodologies.

## Frameworks Used
- NIST RMF (SP 800-37 Rev.2)
- NIST SP 800-30 (Risk Assessment)
- NIST SP 800-53 (Security Controls)

## Project Scope
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- SaaS applications
- Human and third-party risks

## Risk Methodology
- Likelihood (1–3)
- Impact (1–3)
- Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact
- Risk Rating: High / Medium / Low

## Key Deliverables
- Risk Register (Excel)
- Risk Heat Map
- Risk Summary Report
- NIST SP 800-53 Control Mapping

## Top Risks Identified
1. Cloud data breach due to weak IAM controls
2. Credential reuse across SaaS platforms
3. Misconfigured cloud storage services

## Skills Demonstrated
- Risk identification & scoring
- NIST RMF implementation
- Security control mapping
- Risk documentation & reporting
