This Risk Summary Report was developed using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) to evaluate cybersecurity risks for a small cloud-based SaaS startup with approximately ten employees. The assessment focused on cloud infrastructure, identity and access management, user behavior, and third-party dependencies.
The assessment identified several high and medium risks that could significantly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational systems and data. The most critical risks included potential cloud data breaches due to weak identity and access management controls and credential reuse across SaaS platforms. These risks were rated as high based on their likelihood and potential business impact.
Risk mitigation strategies were defined in alignment with NIST RMF guidance and mapped to applicable NIST SP 800-53 security controls. Key recommendations included enforcing least-privilege access, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), implementing centralized logging and monitoring, performing regular vulnerability and patch management, and developing a formal incident response plan.
Following the implementation of recommended mitigation measures, residual risks were evaluated and reduced to acceptable levels. Continuous monitoring and periodic risk reviews were recommended to maintain ongoing risk awareness, support regulatory compliance, and strengthen the organization’s overall security posture as it grows.
This report demonstrates the practical application of NIST RMF concepts, including risk identification, risk analysis, control selection, and continuous monitoring, reflecting real-world Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) practices.
